Results in terms of the metrics created, no need to put the figures of violin plots right now, but just explain their creation

Spot for the speed measurements

Embeddings, subspaces, how they should look like, Unet embeddings, read on that a bit

Sliding window, image, how does it work

Further post processing steps, nuclei segmentation, algorithm that is used now
