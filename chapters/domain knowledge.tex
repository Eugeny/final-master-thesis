    \textit{In silico} fluorescence labeling approach has proven to be very promising as a substitute to the manual cell statining processes [TODO cite all the relevant references]. For example, the research of [TODO cite Christiansen 2018] proves successfull prediction of not only different cell stains for a variety of modalities and cell types, but it can also successfully determine cell viability. However the work is limited mainly to the transmitted light (TL) z-stack imaging, which means that the input to the network is comprised of 3D imaging, which is not the case in this research. [cite Ounkomol 2018] as well shows succeful predictions of several organelles in bright-field TL 3D imaging using 3D convolutional neural networks. There are two very promising studies by [cite Cheng 2021] and [cite LaChance 2020]. Even though the first one manages to reach a state-of-the art performance on label-free fluorescence reconstruction, it uses reflectance images from oblique dark-field illumination as the input, which is a more specific cell imaging acquisition technique. Whereas the second one provides an approach of using an easie imaging technique - DIC imaging as an input, which even shows great results with not high-resolution data. The latter one 
    
    All of the studies mentioned above as well as this thesis rely on the premise that input imaging type (DIC in this work) comprises enough information to predict fluorescence signal from it. Which is a reasonable assumption, as DIC as well as bright-field and phase constract imaging are very often used for determining cell morphology [TODO cite Kasprowicz 2017]

    This chapter provides a brief overview of biological background knowledge needed to understand the process of cell line development (CLD) and the role of fluorescent \textit{in silico} labeling of DIC cell imaging within it. It also covers the fundamentals of deep and machine learning techniques used in this work including clustering and dimentionality reduction approaches. At the end of the chapter a brief summary of the microscopy image acquisition used in the research is outlined.
