    \textit{In silico} fluorescence labeling approach has proven to be very promising as a substitute to the manual cell statining processes [TODO cite all the relevant references]. For example, the research of [TODO cite Christiansen 2018] proves successfull prediction of not only different cell stains for a variety of modalities and cell types, but it can also successfully determine cell viability. However the work is limited mainly to the transmitted light (TL) z-stack imaging, which means that the input to the network is comprised of 3D imaging, which is not the case in this research.

    This chapter provides a brief overview of biological background knowledge needed to understand the process of cell line development (CLD) and the role of fluorescent \textit{in silico} labeling of DIC cell imaging within it. It also covers the fundamentals of deep and machine learning techniques used in this work including clustering and dimentionality reduction approaches. At the end of the chapter a brief summary of the microscopy image acquisition used in the research is outlined.
