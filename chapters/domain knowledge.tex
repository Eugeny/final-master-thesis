    The \textit{in silico} fluorescence labeling approach has proven to be very promising as a substitute to the manual cell staining processes [TODO cite all the relevant references]. For example, the research of [TODO cite Christiansen 2018] did not only prove successful prediction of different cell stains with a variety of modalities and cell types, but it had also successfully determined cell viability. Nevertheless, the study is limited mainly to transmitted light (TL) z-stack imaging. This refers to the networks input being comprised of 3D images, which is not the case in this work. [cite Ounkomol 2018] too shows succeful predictions of several organelles in bright-field TL 3D images using 3D convolutional neural networks. However, switching to 2D data did not yield adequate results for them. Other, newer studies like [cite Ugawa 2021] provide an application of label-free fluorescence predicting already at the sorting stage, when a high-throughput system sorts cells individually. However, only a single-pixel detector is used by this study, meaning that it captures a wave rather than an image. Nonetheless one can recover an image with heavy computations if needed [cite Sadao Ota 2018].

    There are two very promising studies by [cite Cheng 2021] and [cite LaChance 2020]. Even though the former manages to reach a state-of-the art performance on label-free fluorescence reconstruction, it uses reflectance images from oblique dark-field illumination as the input, which is a more specific cell imaging approach. Still, this input provides higher structural contrast in comparison to any transmission technique [cite Boustany 2010]. The latter study uses an easier imaging technique (DIC imaging) as an input, which shows great results even with low-resolution data. Both of these studies provide results based not only on training metrics, but also on performance of the models for metrics used in the downstream tasks. This is very important in the label-free fluorescence labeling research and was not present in papers before LaChance. In the thesis at hand, many methods from the LaChance paper were used as both the data and the processes in the project pipeline of Merck KgaA align very well with the study conducted in that paper.
    
    All of the studies mentioned above, as well as this work rely on the premise that the input imaging type (here DIC) contains enough information to predict the fluorescence signal from it. This is a reasonable assumption because DIC, as well as bright-field and phase contrast imaging, are very often used for determining cell morphology [TODO cite Kasprowicz 2017].

    This chapter provides a brief overview of the biological background needed to understand the process of cell line development (CLD) and the role of fluorescent \textit{in silico} labeling of DIC cell images within. It also covers the fundamentals of deep and machine learning techniques used here including clustering and dimensionality reduction approaches. At the end of the chapter, a brief summary of the microscopy image acquisition process used in the research is given.
