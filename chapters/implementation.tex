\section{Implementation and experiments}
In this chapter the results of all experiments performed for predicting fluorescence signal from four cell organelles: nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and full cell fluorescence are provided and discussed. This part first starts out with a description of the models and data used in the experiments, followed by four subsections dedicated to each of the organelles. Each subsection describes its own different approaches in pre- or postprocessing needed, difficulties that occurred during preparation or training steps as well as the results obtained for each organelle separately.
