\section{Implementation and experiments}
In this chapter the results of all experiments performed for predicting fluorescence signal from 4 cell oganelles: nuclei, endoplaspic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and full cell fluorescence are provided and discussed. It starts first with a description of the models and data used in the experiments, followed by 4 subsections dedicated to each of the organelles. Each subsection describes its own different approaches in, for example, pre- or postprocessing needed, difficulties that occured during preparation or training steps and well as results obtained for each organelle separately. At the end of this chapter an alternative way of the models performance estimation is provided, which is very important for the practical application of them.
