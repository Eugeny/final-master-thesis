\section{Model robustness and drift detection}
    In this chapter the stability and robustness of the trained models are presented. First subsection shows models' performance on the corrupted DIC input data with two sources of corrupted signal: artificial pseudocorruptions and real corruptions from the microscope settings. It presents the influence of augmentations on the robusteness, studies the influence of corruptions on practical biological metrics and shows how generalizable the models are across phenotypes. Second subsection presents a study of the image representations in the UNet embeddings including their possible clustering in the lower dimensional space based on several possible clustering hypotheses. And finally the last subsection covers the results of the drift detection algorithm built to alert end users when models predictions become unreliable. Which happens when there is a difference between the data used for training and the data used during inference.
