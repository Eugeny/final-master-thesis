\subsection{Endoplasmic Reticulum}
    \label{section:er}
    Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of membranes inside a cell, through which proteins and other molecules move. Ribosomes are small and round organelles with the main function to produce the protein needed for the cell. They are located in a continuous membrane system that forms series of flattened sacs, this membrane is called ER (see Figure \ref{fig:cell}) (\cite{er}). ER itself is moslty located around the nuclei. In order to stain ER, CHO cells were treated with Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG antibody. This is a fluorescent stain that binds strongly with ER. The analysis of this cell organelle is also important for the CLD as ER is directly related to the process of protein production within the cell: it is responsible for the synthesis, folding, modification, and transport of proteins (\cite{er_2}). The proximity of the ER to the nucleus essentially allows to control the protein production. For example, when the protein is incorrectly folded it will be accumulated in the ER lumen and it will serve as a signal to activate misfolded protein response from the cell. In contrast to other imaging datasets ER dataset does not require special preprocessing steps as the images are of a good quality and without any visible problems (see the ground truth image in Figure \ref{fig:er-combined}).
