\subsection{Golgi}
    Golgi apparatus (or Golgi, or Golgi complex) is another organelle inside the cell that packages proteins into membrane-bound vescicles, that will be exported from the cell. Golgi is located also near the nucleus and ER as well, it is even called a perinuclear body. This location is explained by the bilogical processes: after a protein comes out of the ER, it goes into the Golgi for further processing (\cite{golgi}). The staining of Golgi apparatus has turned out to be the most difficult of all. Two antibodies were tried out for stating here, however both of them resulted in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Many images were underexposed, and the density of the cells after their fixating was pretty low. The hypothesis why this was the case was that the choice of target protein in Golgi to which anti body can bind to was not the best. Golgi appartus is a difficult target even having a fluorescence imaging with high signal-to-noise ratio (lowest scores among all cell organelles in state-of-the-art \cite{Cheng_2021} paper were achieved exactly on Golgi).
