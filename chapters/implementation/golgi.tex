\subsection{Golgi}
    Golgi apparatus (or Golgi, or Golgi complex) is another organelle inside the cell that packages proteins into membrane-bound vescicles, that will be exported from the cell. Golgi is located also near the nucleus and ER as well, it is even called a perinuclear body. This location is explained by the bilogical processes: after a protein comes out of the ER, it goes into the Golgi for further processing (\cite{golgi}). The staining of Golgi apparatus turned out to be the most difficult of all.
