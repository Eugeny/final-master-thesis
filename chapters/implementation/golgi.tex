\subsection{Golgi apparatus}
    The Golgi apparatus (or Golgi, or Golgi complex) is another organelle inside the cell that packages proteins into membrane-bound vesicles which will be exported from the cell. Golgi is also located near the nucleus and ER as well, it is even called a perinuclear body. This location is explained by the biological processes: after a protein comes out of the ER, it goes into the Golgi for further processing (\cite{golgi}). The staining of Golgi apparatus has turned out to be the most difficult of all. Two antibodies were tried out in the beginning, however both of them resulted in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Many images were underexposed, and the density of the cells after their fixation was pretty low. The hypothesis why this was the case was that the choice of target protein in Golgi to which antibody can bind to was not the best. Golgi appartus represents an interest for this study, because it is a very difficult fluorescence target. Even having a fluorescence imaging with high signal-to-noise ratio, the lowest scores among all cell organelles in state-of-the-art paper \cite{Cheng_2021} were achieved on Golgi.
