\section{Future research}
"
One limitation of our current work is that it is based on fixed cells that does not allow longitudinal imaging. This can be overcome by using fluorescent reporter cell lines or live cell dyes to provide the fluorescence ground truth (10) and enable dynamic observation. Another limitation of the DL framework we used here is that it cannot be generalized to different types of cells. Techniques based on transfer learning (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-019-0362-y, https://downloads.spj.sciencemag.org/bmef/2020/9647163.pdf) and domain adaptation (38) will be investigated in our future work to overcome this limitation."
