Since the UNet embeddgins are the most promising for clustering based on input corruptions we will proceed with this approach. Apart from dimensionality reduction methods used in section \ref{section:unet-embeddings-dim-reduction}, PaCMAP clustering was tried. You can find its detailed description in section \ref{section:pacmap}. 
\begin{figure}[htb]

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

PaCMAP allows a more flexible hyperparameter tuning in order to preserve local and global relations from high-dimentional data and as result a better clustering can be found. As usual PaCMAP was trained using "good" training data only, meaning no corruptions were introduced. And only when the transformation from high-dimensional into a lower dimensional space was found, corrupted crops were projected using this transformation. Figure \ref{fig:unet-clustering} presents results of training PaCMAP with 4 different hyperparametrization settings. There are 3 hyperparameters that were changed here: MN\_ratio, FP\_ratio and n\_neighbors. Detailed explanation of their influence was also described in section \ref{section:pacmap}. From left to right in Figure \ref{fig:unet-clustering}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item MN\_ratio=0.5, FP\_ratio=0.1, n\_neighbors=10
	\item MN\_ratio=0.1, FP\_ratio=0.1, n\_neighbors=10
	\item MN\_ratio=0.5, FP\_ratio=0.5, n\_neighbors=2
	\item MN\_ratio=0.1, FP\_ratio=0.5, n\_neighbors=10
\end{itemize}

In this case cluster of green dots represents projected UNet embeddings of images corrupted with defocus blur with severity level $4$, which is already a strong corruption and leads to unacceptable predictions of the model, that did not have defocus blur augmentations. However, these point are still strongly mixed with not corrupted ones. In order to check how separable they are unsupervised clustering DBSCAN alogorithm was used. Results of this clustering are shown in Figure \ref{fig:unet-clustering-sev-levels}. Density based clustering approach used here was described in details in section \ref{section:dbscan}. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{bilder/unet-embeddings/db-levels.png}
		\caption{Clustering of UNet embeddings after PacMAP for different severities levels}
		\label{fig:unet-clustering-sev-levels}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

After training DBSCAN on not corrupted crops embeddings it has recognized a class on the right (yellow dots) as a cluster and the rest of the points (blue ones) as noise, because they have quite low density in comparison to the yellow cluster. This is not a problem if we consider noisy points simply as a separate cluster. For such clustering defocus blur of level $4$ splits the crops between two clusters with an F1-score of $0.74$. In Figure \ref{fig:unet-clustering-sev-levels} on the right red points represent projection of image embeddings after corrupting them with a defocus blur of severity level $3$. In this case they are mixed with not corrupted projections even stronger. Here prediction of already trained DBSCAN drops to F1-score of $0.64$.

Overall UNet embeddings do express clustering of corrupted embeddings to a small extent, however not strongly enough to use it in practice. Autoencoder here would be a better approach, however brightness normalization has to take place first. It is recommended to proceed the research here in the direction of contrastive learning algorithms, specifically \cite{csi} approach.
