It is important that any image is fed into the network crop by crop, meaning that for each crop there is separate embedding. In this section image embeddings are not combined in any way together and were analysed separately. However, it is strongly recommended for a further research to evaluate all the experiments by finding projections in a lower-dimensional space not only of separate crops, but of the image as the whole. For example, simply by averaging embeddings for all crops from the same image. In all experiments here a model trained on nuclei dataset was used.

UNet embedding is of size $16 \times 16 \times 256$ and can be flattened into a $655536$-dimensional vector. In order to comprehend the embeddings for us as humans, any dimensionality reduction algorithm has to be applied. One option would be to compress a vector to 2D or 3D-dimentional representation, which is easily comprehendable by humans.

\end{figure}

In this case a two-dimensional representation was chosen. With the help of PCA, UMAP and their combination embeddings were projected into a 2D space. In Figure \ref{fig:umap-pca-embeddings} one can see the clouds of dots, where each dot represents a projected UNet embedding of a crop. Both research questions are addressed here: clustering based on phenotypes (CHOZN or PHX) and clustering based on input corruptions (defocus blur of severity level $4$). It is very important here that corrupted data was not used in training of any of dimensionality reduction methods. The goal was to use only the data available in trianing dataset, find the transformation of high-dimentional data into a lower-dimentional space and apply it to new samples. That is also why methods like t-sne \cite{t-sne} cannot be used here, because the transformation t-sne learns cannot be applied to new samples.

From Figure \ref{fig:umap-pca-embeddings} it is clear that there is no clustering based on the phenotype is happening. However, green corrupted dots seem to clump more in groups, occupying either one side (a, d) or area around the center (b). It is also clear that the combination of UMAP with previously applied PCA works better with the increasing amount of components in PCA: dots in (d) seem to form a better cluster than dots in (c). Yet it is still not intuitive from this Figure how many not corrupted dots are hidden behind the cluster of the green ones --- meaning whether non corrupted crops cluster intersects severely with a corrupted one. In order to visualize that better one can use a kernel density estimate (KDE) plot presented in Figure \ref{fig:kde}. Additionally, it is clear that vanilla UMAP is not the best approach for the extreme number of dimentions as one has in this case.

a cluster of corrupted images is clearly present here, however it also intersects with many non corrupted crops. The quantitive evaluation of how this cluster if separable from the rest of the points is provided in section \ref{section:clustering-on-unet-embeddings}. Altough one can already state that there is a clear opportunity to differentiate between corrupted and not corrupted images, due to clusters being not well separable the accuracy cannot be high. For further research we suggest to additionally check whether clusters may form into a high-dimensional space before projecting them into a 2D space.
