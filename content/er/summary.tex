Training the model on the ER stain images produced very successful results that can be used as a replacement for manual staining with \textit{in silico} labeling. Overfit of the model has been encountered and several experiments using augmentations and weight decay were performed to overcome it, the best checkpoint was selected and evaluated.

The segmentation of ER for further biological metrics evaluation was proposed. The problem of overlap between cells being present was discovered, which causes the segmented regions to merge together. Subsequently, an improved preprocessing algorithm was proposed. This algorithm helps to avoid the artifacts appearing from a local thresholding.

The combination of ER with nuclei predictions was visualized and analysed, it was confirmed that the models produce realistic results confirming biological definition of their mutual arrangement within the cell. This result shows the power of the combination of the UNet models --- they allow to predict several fluorescence targets based on the same DIC input, such a procedure is very difficult to be performed manually.
