\paragraph{Image acquisition peculiarities} 
    Cells used in this research are growing in 96-well plates. A plate or a microplate in biology is a flat plate with multiple tubes ("wells"). The microscope used in the experiments takes photos of the well plate in random locations. The reason for that hides in the focusing settings of a  microscope. To get a reasonably good not blurry photo a microscope has to focus on a specific location of the plate, the choice of this location however happens automatically, therefore the location of the focus is random (see Figure \ref{fig:random-dic}). 
    
    It might be problematic in the following sense: photos takes in such manner do not gurantee that the focus will land in distinct spots all the time. Meaning that some cells present in one of the photos might appear in the other ones as well. Since the photos are high-resolution they weil be first splitted into crops of size $256 \times 256$ each during the preprocessing. And it might happen that same cells might appear in several crops. That is why after the split of the image data between train, test and validation sets it might also happen that the same set of cells will once land in the train set and another time in the validation set, which will lead to a not completely fair and representative validaiton metrics during training.
    
    In order to overcome this problem a much more expensive equipment is needed. Since in this case it doesn't bring too huge problems except for the fact that validation metrics might be lower than they should have been, there was no need to purchase a more expensive equipment.
