Convolutional neural network, Autoencoder, embedding, optimizers, regularization, descriptions of how each layer works.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture nonlinear rela- tionships over large areas of images, resulting in vastly improved performance for image recognition tasks as compared to classical machine learning methods
