One can see an example of how Golgi fluorescence staining looks like in Figure \ref{fig:golgi-enhancement}. It is evident that there is a lighter foreground fluorescence and a bit darker one in the background. A true Golgi signal here is considered to be only the lighter part of fluorescence lightning. The light gray background present here is called a non-specific fluorescence lightning. It comes from the cell itself, and might occur when the antigen is impure and contains antigenic contaminants (\cite{Borek_1984}). And brightness of it may vary due to longer or shorter exposure times.

Having such a non-specific fluorescence background has two challenges for training:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The relative area of the background fluorescence is bigger than the area of Golgi themselves. Therefore quite a big part in the loss during training will be dedicated to teaching model to restore this background fluorescence instead of the Golgi itself.
    \item It introduces difficulties during the post-processing of the predictions. As well as for nuclei, the mask of the predicted Golgi apparatus is needed for further evaluation of the downstream metrics. Using the same algorithm for post-processing segmentation that was used for nuclei, the mask of the Golgi Apparatus will consider the background noise to be relevant, although this is an unwanted behavior.
\end{itemize}

On the left of Figure \ref{fig:golgi-enhancement} one can see the original ground truth image and on the right --- the images after the background was substracted. One of the great background subtraction algorithms is the rolling ball algorithm which is described below.

Additionally, all of the crops used for training were filtered base on the amount of background they contain. Without filtering the crops that contain a lot of background, a big portion of a dataset would be black crops only, which creates very strong class imbalance.
