Subtracting the background with the rolling ball algorithm unfortunately is still not enough to get a reasonably clean signal of Golgi apparatus from fluorescence imaging, as a lot of background noise will still be present there. In Figure \ref{subfig:vanilla} one can see a fluorescence image preprocessed with a rolling ball algorithm. After turning it into a binary image that can be seen in Figure \ref{subfig:vanilla-mask}, it becomes clear that the images still contains a lot of background low-intensity noise, which was not visible for an eye.

In order to get rid of it one could clip lower intensities of the image via image enhancement. In order to do that one can simply clip all the intensities below $90$-th percentile of the image and normalize it afterwards. The result of the clipped image and its mask are illustated in Figure \ref{subfig:clipping}, \ref{subfig:clipping-mask} correspondingly. It contains almost no background noise now. Such additional clipping has improved the results slightly.
